Software Packages 

Ubuntu uses Debian (.deb) packages. 

Pre-approved package repositories are located at /etc/apt/sources.list 

 

Compressed and Archived Files 

Gzip is used to compress a file and tar is used to create an archive of multiple files. 

 

gzip is a program to compress single  files (.gz) 

gzip myfile #compress a file 

gunzip myfile.gz #decompress a file 

 

Tar is used to archive multiple files (.tar) 

tar cvf mytarfile.tar myfile1 myfile2 #create a tar archive 

c - create 

v - tell the program to be verbose and let us see what it’s doing 

f – the filename of the tar file has to come after this option, if you are creating a tar file you'll have to come up with a name. 

 

tar xvf mytarfile.tar #unpack tar archive 

x – extract 

v – verbose 

f – the file you want to extract 

 

tar czf my file.tar.gz #create a compressed tar file 

z – use to gzip or gunzip utility 

 

tar xzf file.tar #uncompress and unpack (eXtract all Zee Files) 

 

Install a .deb file 

.deb is an executable like .exe 

 

dpkg -i some_deb_package.deb 

i – install 

 

dpgk –r some_deb_package.deb 

r – remove 

 

dpkg –l #list installed packages 

l – list 

 

Install/remove a package from a repository 

apt install package_name #Install a package from a repository 

 

apt remove package_name #Remove a package 

 

Get information about installed package 

apt show package_name 

 

Compile source code 

The package build-essential is required. 

1)extract the file 

2)open the README or INSTALL file 

3) ./configure #checks for dependencies 

Option 1 

4)make 

5a)sudo make install 

5b)sudo make uninstall 

Option 2 

4)sudo checkinstall #use instead of make install. This makes a .deb file.
